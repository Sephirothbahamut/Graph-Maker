/*! \page page_manual_requirements Requirements
<p>Angelscript version >= 2.31.0</p>
A c++ compiler that supports these c++11 features
-# header <atomic> (for a spinlock)
-# container <unordered_set>
-# container <unordered_map>
<p>The c++11 features required can be quite easily replaced with boost equivalents if you want to use AATC with an older compiler.</p>
<p>Your angelscript engine needs a string registered (been developing with the official addon scriptstdstring)</p>
<p>There is no generic call convention interface available yet, so if your angelscript project was dependant on that, you can't use AATC yet.</p>
